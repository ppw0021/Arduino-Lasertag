# DIY Arduino Lasertag

This is an Arduino powered Infrared laser tag set I created. It is powered using an Arduino Nano. The set has 6 primary functions and features such as, ammunition counter, hit-detection from other laser tag guns, IR data analysis, reloading button paired with a slider, LCD user interface and finally a play feedback subsystem as well as features such as 8 different weapons, filtration of teamfire and a health counter.

## Description

Explanation


## 3D printed parts
Each laser tag gun consists of 13 3D printed parts. The guns structure uses a middle black frame which holds a majority of the electronic components and microcontroller, while 4 large shells cover both sides of the black frame.

As this was a long time and I did not know any better, I created the 3D models in SketchUp (ðŸ¤®) and exported them as very very broken STLs. I used Netfabb to fix the models and make them manifold.
I recommend using Black, White and Clear PLA or ABS plastic at 0.1mm layer height for best results. 

## Electronics

The microcontroller for this project is an Arduino Nano with an ATmega328p chip onboard.
The following components are required for each laser gun:
- 1x IR LED  (For signal transmission)
- 1x 31MM biconvex lens 27MM focal point  (For straightening the IR light from the IR LED)
- 6x IR Receiver TSOP4838 DIP3  (For receiving transmissions from other laser guns)
- 1x i2c 16x2 LCD display modules  (For displaying UI to user)
- 1x YX5300 UART Serial MP3 player  (For playing sounds)
- 1x MicroSD card  (For storing sounds)
- 3x DC3v Button Vibrating Motors  (For providing haptic feedback)
- 6x push buttons  (For navigating UI and reload switches)
- 1x PAM8403 digital amplifier (For amplifying the audio signal from the MP3 Player)
  - 1x 4omh speaker
  - 1x 4.7uF capacitor
  - (Please note these parts are quite arbitrary and were subject is guesswork, results may vary)
- 7x 1k ohm resistors (Various pulldown )
- 1x NPN transistor
- 

## Code

The code is very straight forward and simple, but a calibration will need to be done to find the correct threshold.
